# PCAX

## Introduction

pcax is a Python JAX-based library designed to develop highly configurable predictive coding networks. It is strictly forbidden to share any piece of code without permission.

## Environment Configuration with `poetry`

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to make sure the environment is 100% reproducible. If you are not familiar with `poetry`, now is a good time to skim through the docs.

In a nutshell:
1. If you need to add a Python package to the environment, use `poetry add package`. Avoid `pip install`!
2. If you want to update a version of an existing package, run `poetry update package`. It will update the package to the latest available version that fits the constraints.
3. **DO NOT** update the package versions in the `pyproject.toml` file manually. Surprisingly, `pyproject.toml` **DOES NOT** specify the versions that will be installed, `poetry.lock` does. So, first check the package version in `poetry.lock`.
4. **DO NOT** update the package versions in the `poetry.lock` file manually. Use `poetry update package` instead. `poetry.lock` **HAS** to be generated and signed automatically.
5. If `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` have diverged for some reason (for example, you've merged another branch and resolved conflicts in `poetry.lock`), use `poetry lock --no-update` to fix the `poetry.lock` file.
6. **DO NOT** commit changes to `pyproject.toml` without running `poetry lock --no-update` to synchronize the `poetry.lock` file. If you commit `pyproject.toml` that is not in sync with `poetry.lock` this will break the automatic environment configuration for everyone.

## Environment in Docker with Dev Containers

Run your development environment in a docker container. This is the most straightforward option to work with `pcax`, as the development environment is pre-configured for you.

The `Dockerfile` is located in `pcax/docker`, with the `run.sh` script that builds and runs it. You can play with the `Dockerfile` directly if you know what you are doing or if you don't use VSCode. If you want a fully automated environment setup, then forget about the `pcax/docker` directory and read on.

**Warning**: This image should run on CUDA 12.2 or later, but not earlier. Make sure that your `nvidia-smi` reports CUDA >=12.2. If not, update the base `nvidia/cuda` image and the fix at the bottom in the `docker/Dockerfile` to use the same version of CUDA as your host does.

Requirements:

1. A CUDA >=12.2 enabled machine with an NVIDIA GPU. You can do without a GPU, probably, just omit the steps related to the GPU passthrough and configuration.
2. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
3. Install [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit) to enable docker to use the GPU.
4. **Make sure to re-start the docker daemon after the previous step**. For example, on Ubuntu this will be `sudo systemctl restart docker`.
5. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
6. Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) in VSCode.
7. Optionally, [read how to develop inside container with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

Once everything is done, open this project in VS Code and execute the `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` command (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P). This will build the docker image and open the project inside that docker image. Building the docker image for the first time may take around 15-30 minutes, depending on your internet speed.

You can always exit the container by running the `Dev Containers: Reopen folder locally` command.
You can rebuild the container by running the `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container` command.

You can check that you're running inside a container by running `hostname`. If it outputs meaningless 12 characters, then you are inside a container. If it outputs the name of your machine, you are not in a container.

When running a Jupyter Notebook it will prompt you to select an environment. Select Python Environments -> Python 3.10 (any of them, as they are the same).

**Important notes**:
1. You are not supposed to modify the `docker/Dockerfile` unless you perfectly know what you are doing and why.
1. You are not supposed to run the docker container directly. The Dev Containers extension will do this for you. If you think you need to `docker run -it` then something is really wrong.
1. Use `poetry` to add a python package to the environment: `poetry add --group dev [package]`. The `--group dev` part should be omitted if this package is needed for the core `pcax` code. Try not to install packages with `pip`.
1. Please update your docker to >>20.10.9. [This image is known not to work with docker <= 20.10.9](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71941032/why-i-cannot-run-apt-update-inside-a-fresh-ubuntu22-04). It failes with the following message: `E: Problem executing scripts APT::Update::Post-Invoke 'rm -f /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/*.deb /var/cache/apt/*.bin || true'`.
1. Sometimes Pylance fails to start because it depends on the Python extension that starts later. In this case, just reload the window by running the `Developer: Reload window` command.

**PyTorch with GPU support**: By default, the image will install a CPU-only PyTorch. If you need GPU support with PyTorch, do the following:
1. Open the project in a container using DevContainers as described above.
1. Replace ALL occurrences of `source = "torch-cpu"` with `source = "torch-gpu"` in the [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) file.
1. Run `poetry lock --no-update` to re-generate the `poetry.lock` file. Note that you should do it while running inside the container.
1. Run `poetry install`. Make sure you run it inside the container. It will take up to 20 minutes.

## Install

First, create an environment with Python 3.10 or newer and [install JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) in the correct version for your accelerator device. For cuda >= 12.0, the command is

```shell
pip install -U "jax[cuda12]"
```

For CPU only:

```shell
pip install -U "jax[cpu]"
```

Then you hav two options:

-   Install a stable version
-   Clone this repository and install the package by linking to the this folder. The installation of this libary only links to this folder and thus dynamically updates with all your changes.

### Install stable version

On the right side of the repository, click on "releases" and download the wheel file. You can install it using

```shell
pip install path/to/wheel_file.whl
```

### Install dynamically from github

Clone this repository locally and then:

```shell
pip install -e /path/to/this/repo/ --config-settings editable_mode=strict
```

## Docs

Go to `/docs/README.md` to learn how to get them.

## Contribute

Please use a new branch to contribute. Once you are done writing the feature, please open a Pull Request. A few github actions will be triggered: Formatting, Linting, Type Checking and Testing. These steps ensure that the library maintains a certain level of quality and fascilitate collaboration.

-   Formatting: We use `black` to format the code. Check out [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) for the arguments. This ensures that all files from all authors are coherently formatted.
-   Linting: This checks the code for style quality using `flake8` and `isort`. `flake8` complains about style errors, as for example variable names that are too generic or there exist unused imports. `isort` complains if the imports within each block are not alphabetically ordered. For linting arguments check [setup.cfg](setup.cfg).
-   Type Checking: This checks if type hints match the types that are actually passed through the code using `mypy`. This isnt infallable but it helps a lot making the typing more explicit. If you can't find a solution to satisfy `mypy` you can mark that line with a `# type: ignore` comment and `mypy` will ignore errors in this line. For arguments check [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).
-   Testing: All code in the library should be explicitly tested. We use `pytest` to do that. Please add tests for any feature you implement.

The GHA only check that everything is in order, but does not alter the code for you. Please, do the formatting, testing etc locally. You can use the logs of the GHA to see where it is failing. Once all the GHA pass, request Luca as a reviewer for your PR. Once he approves, you should use the `Squash and Merge` functionalty to merge your feature on the main branch. `Squash and Merge` means that all your little commits on the feature branch will be bundles into one big commit and keep the commit tree tidy.

Please add comments and docstrings to your changes.

One warning: We cannot test GPU features on GHA. Please do this locally as well, even though it might not result in an error in the GHA.

### VSCode

This might be useful when using vscode:
Add this to you `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
    "python.linting.mypyEnabled": true,
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.formatting.blackArgs": ["--line-length 120"]
}
```

It will continuously check your code using flake8 and mypy and set the formatting to black. As the linting is expensive, creating pre-commit hooks would be nicer though.

### Skip Github Actions

If you want to skip github actions on a single commit (e.g. an intermediate commit or comment that does not need to be checked), you can start your commit message with `[skip ci]`.
