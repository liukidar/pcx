    "It may be the case that your optimizers defines some parameters that are linked to the individual trainable parameter inside your model. For instance, you could choose to use `optax.adam` for `optim_x` (not recommended, for all we know you should stick with stateless optimizators for the value nodes). In this case, the optimizer needs to instantiate the `adam` parameters and, thus, it requires to know the shape of all the `px.NodeVar`s inside your model. However, if we do not run the model at least once, all the node values will be empty, since they are lazily created. Furthermore, the shape of the value nodes depends on the batch size (since, remember, we want different value nodes for each different input), so we need to perform a dummy run on a dummmy input with the same shape of the samples we are gonna train on to correctly initialize all the parameters inside the model. Only then we can safely create the two optimizers. (Note that this requires `batch_size` to be constant throught the program. To guarantee this, by default, the dataloaders have `drop_last=True`. Unless you know what you're doing, do not attempt to modify that.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It actually doesn't really matter what you pass as `x` and `t`, but only that their shape matches the one of the true input batches (but in this way you can see how you can pass `None` as the target of the predict function: it needs to be batched as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "This explains the `predict(...)` line. And the `with ...` line comes with it: `px.Module` uses an internal caching system to store intermediate values for later computations. `px.eval` takes care of clearing this cache. Therefore, every time you call `predict` (or, more precisely, you use `px.Module` to compute some values given an input, as it happens in the `__call__` function), you must enclose it under a `px.eval` manager (which also sets the module in eval mode), so that when you'll change the input, you are not gonna reuse the previously computed cached values. There's a similar context manager for training: `px.train`. They do slightly different things, but don't worry for now."
