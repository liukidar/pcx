    "    3. Generate a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve based on the energies to assess the model's ability to distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Plot true positive rate (sensitivity) against false positive rate (1-specificity) for different threshold values of energies.\n",

    "    5. Create a scatter plot of energies versus prediction confidence (max softmax value) for both MNIST and FashionMNIST. Goal is to investigate the relationship/correlation between model confidence and energy value. Use different colors or markers for MNIST and FashionMNIST data points.\n",
